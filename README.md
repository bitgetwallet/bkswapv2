# BitKeep Swap v2

## About 
The library contains a smart contract for EVM-based blockchains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, etc.), which serves as a critical part of the BitKeep Swap order-splitting protocol.

This contract allows users to carry out token swap and supports order-splitting in large amounts. It aggregates 1inch, dodo, uniswap, 0x and other order-splitting protocols, facilitating users' access to the liquidity of hundreds of Dex. Meanwhile, it provides users with the best swap price and saves gas fees. 

## Deployments 

The protocol is deployed by CREATE2 Factory with the same address on each EVM. The address is as follows
